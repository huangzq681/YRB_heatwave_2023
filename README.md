## What's included
### Notebook
All the analysis and visualization code are performed using Jupyter notebook in a python environment.
The analysis notebooks include the ensemble constructed circulation analogue (CCA) analysis for the 2022 YRB heatwave specifically and for the whole research period (during 1979~2022).
Both geopotential height at 500 hPa pressure level (Z500) and sea level pressure (SLP) are utilized for the ensemble CCA analysis.
